            I like drawing because you can put your imaganetion in it and you can make whatever you want to .Like I have made plenty of darwing in some I have made seneries in some I have made potraits and some I used my imagnation and made . Art is a thing that anyone can make because art is everything like scribbling you will make paterns!! big people can make big drawing you make and do whatever you want in art that is why I like it a lot .
